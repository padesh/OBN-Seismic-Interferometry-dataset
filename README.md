## Usage  

### Sections 3.3.1 and 3.3.2
For these sections, the velocity/dispersion tensors are stored in a **single `.npy` file**.  You can load and access them as follows:  

```
import numpy as np

# Load the file
data = np.load("file_name.npy", allow_pickle=True).item()

# Access individual components
Crr = data["Crr"]
Cvv = data["Cvv"]
Crv = data["Crv"]
```

### Other Sections
For these sections, the velocity VSG/dispersion are stored in a **single `.npy` file**. You can load and access them as follows:  

```
import numpy as np

data = np.load("file_name.npy")
```
